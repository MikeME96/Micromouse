### Maze-Solving Algorithm

The Flood Fill algorithm assigns values to each cell based on Manhattan distance from the goal. The robot continuously updates the maze map, recalculating the shortest path dynamically.

#### Steps:

  1. Assume no walls and plan the shortest path to the goal.
  2. Navigate while detecting walls with IR sensors.
  3. Update the maze map in real-time and re-calculate the best route.
  4. After mapping, follow the optimized shortest path at higher speed.

### Control System

#### The cascade PID control structure consists of:

  * Outer loop: Position control (PI controller)
  * Inner loop: Velocity control (PID controller)

#### PID tuning process:

  First, the position controller was tuned for minimal steady-state error.
  Next, the velocity controller was tuned for smooth acceleration and stability.

### Movement & Navigation

  * Moving forward: Uses QEI encoders to track distance.
  * Turning: Pre-calculated encoder counts ensure precise 90¬∞ and 180¬∞ rotations.
  * Wall following & centering: IR sensors adjust speed to maintain correct positioning.
  * Stopping accuracy: The robot slows down near walls to minimize error.

### Challenges & Limitations

#### ‚úÖ Successes:

  * Successfully mapped and solved a 4x4 maze under different configurations.
  * Found the shortest path using real-time updates.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:

  * Requires at least one wall per cell for precise turning.
  * Bluetooth is used to start the robot, which may not meet full competition rules.
  * Performance could improve with gyroscope-based alignment and a lighter LiPo battery.

### Future Improvements

  * Full compliance with competition rules by adding onboard start buttons.
  * PCB redesign for improved space efficiency and direct motor integration.
  * More advanced control strategies to handle turns without relying on walls.
